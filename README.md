# GameGrabber
A work in progress. Will be a web app that amalgamates, displays, computes, and compares data for Video Games on all platforms.

<h2> Requirements </h2>
<p> lxml, Beautiful Soup 4, requests, python 3.6 </p>

<h2> Instructions: </h2>
<p> Launch python main.py, and follow the prompt to visualize the data accrual process of the program. While there is a barebones
command UI, eventually I plan to have the project overhauled in Django. </p>

<h2> How it Works: </h2>
<p> GameGrabber reaches out to various websites and Databases, including VGChartz, igdb, MetaCritic, and the Games Database in order to 
provide the user with the most comprehensive overview of whatever Game they are most interested in. Eventually, I plan to implement
methods that allow comparisons of games and their sales data, price over time, and popularity. The more data, the better.
